Healthy eating doesn't need to be restrictive or complicated.

### Focus on whole foods
Lean proteins, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats.

### Balanced meals
Include protein, carbs, and fats in each meal.

### Hydration matters
Drink water consistently throughout the day.

### Avoid over-restriction
Sustainable nutrition is about consistency, not perfection.
